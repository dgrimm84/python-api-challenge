# Discussion about the linear relationship of Latitude vs. Temperature

### Northern Hemisphere
> - There is a negative correlation (indicated with a slope of -0.87) meaning that as the latitude decreases (moving closer to the North pole) the temperature decreases
> - The equation of y=−0.87x+92.39 indicates that with each decrease in latitude by 1 degree, the temperature goes down by 0.87 degrees.  And, 92.39 indcates the estimated temperature at 0 latitude (the equator) based on these trends.
> - The r-value of -0.80 signifies that the negative correlation is significant but not perfect.  This means that while a higher latitude does have a strong correlation to decreasing temperature, there are enough outliers to signify that there is still an influence of other factors in this relationship

### Southern Hemisphere
> - There is a positive correlation (indicated with a slope of 0.14) meaning that as the latitude increases (moving closer to the equator) the temperature increases
> - The equation of y=−0.57x+87.32 indicates that with each increase in latitude by 1 degree, the temperature goes up by 0.57 degrees.  And, 82.32 indcates the estimated temperature at 0 latitude (the equator) based on these trends.
> - The r-value of -0.68 signifies that the positive correlation is relatively weak.   This means that the positive correlation between temperature and latitude in the Southern Hemisphere is weaker than the Northern Hemisphere and other factors play a larger role in this comparison



# Discussion about the linear relationship of Latitude vs. Humidity

### Northern Hemisphere
> - There is a positive correlation (indicated with a slope of 0.15) meaning that as the latitude increases (moving closer to the North pole) the humidity increases ever so slightly
> - The equation of y=−0.15x+64.26 indicates that with each decrease in latitude by 1 degree, the humidity goes up by 0.12 percent.  And, 64.26 indcates the estimated humidity percentage at 0 latitude (the equator) based on these trends.
> - The r-value of 0.12 signifies that the positive correlation is almost non-existant.  This means that increasing latitude hardly affects the humidity percentage at all.  

### Southern Hemisphere
> - There is a positive correlation (indicated with a slope of 0.12) meaning that as the latitude increases (moving closer to the equator) the humidity increases
> - The equation of y=0.12x+72.2 indicates that with each increase in latitude by 1 degree, the humidity goes up by 0.12 percent.  And, 72.2 indcates the estimated humidity percentage at 0 latitude (the equator) based on these trends.
> - The r-value of 0.07 signifies that the positive correlation is extremely weak.   This means that the positive correlation between temperature and latitude in the Southern Hemisphere is even weaker than the already-weak Northern Hemisphere and other factors play an almost total role in this relationship


# Discussion about the linear relationship of Latitude vs. Cloudiness

### Northern Hemisphere
> - There is an extremely weak positive correlation (indicated with a slope of 0.09) meaning that as the latitude increases (moving closer to the North pole) the cloudiness increases at a very small rate
> - The equation of y = 0.09x + 57.19 indicates that with each decrease in latitude by 1 degree, the cloudiness goes up by 0.09 percent.  And, 54.19 indcates the estimated cloudiness percentage at 0 latitude (the equator) based on these trends.
> - The r-value of 0..09 signifies that the positive correlation is almost non-existant.  This means that increasing latitude hardly affects the cloudiness percentage at all.  

### Southern Hemisphere
> - There is a positive correlation (indicated with a slope of 0.09) meaning that as the latitude increases (moving closer to the equator) the cloudiness increases at a very small rate
> - The equation of y = 0.09x + 54.19 indicates that with each increase in latitude by 1 degree, the cloudiness goes up by 0.09 percent.  And, 54.19 indcates the estimated humidity percentage at 0 latitude (the equator) based on these trends.
> - The r-value of 0.03 signifies that the positive correlation is almost non-exsitant.   This means that the positive correlation between cloudiness and latitude in the Southern Hemisphere is even weaker than the already-weak Northern Hemisphere and other factors play an almost total role in this relationship


# Discussion about the linear relationship of Latitude vs. Wind Speed

### Northern Hemisphere
> - There is an extremely weak positive correlation (indicated with a slope of 0.09) meaning that as the latitude increases (moving closer to the North pole) the wind speed increases at a very small rate
> - The equation of y = 0.03x + 7.39 indicates that with each decrease in latitude by 1 degree, the wind speed goes up by 0.03 miles per hour.  And, 7.39 indcates the estimated wind speed at 0 latitude (the equator) based on these trends.
> - The r-value of 0.09 signifies that the positive correlation is almost non-existant.  This means that increasing latitude hardly affects the wind speed at all.  

### Southern Hemisphere
> - There is a negative correlation (indicated with a slope of -0.11) meaning that as the latitude increases (moving closer to the equator) the wind speed decreases at a small rate
> - The equation of y = -0.11x + 6.94 indicates that with each increase in latitude by 1 degree, the wind speed goes down -0.11 miles per hour.  And, 6.94 indcates the estimated wind speed at 0 latitude (the equator) based on these trends.
> - The r-value of-0.28 signifies that the negative correlation is small but present.   This means that the negative correlation between wind speed and latitude in the Southern Hemisphere is slightly stronger than the Northern Hemisphere but other factors still play a very large total role in this relationship
